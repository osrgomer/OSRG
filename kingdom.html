                Deep in the heart of Canada's Northwest Territories lies OSRG's Kingdom, crowned by the majestic Mackenzie Mountains. Our Royal Castle stands proudly at 2,000 meters, offering breathtaking views of Great Bear Lake's pristine waters to the east and the sparkling Beaufort Sea (our beloved Crystal Sea) to the north.

                Our realm stretches between the magnificent Richardson Mountains in the west and the ancient Coppermine Mountains in the east. This vast territory is a tapestry of natural wonders: endless boreal forests, mirror-like lakes, and pristine wilderness. At its heart, our capital city rests in a sheltered valley, blessed with nature's most spectacular shows – the dancing Northern Lights in winter and the enchanting midnight sun in summer.
